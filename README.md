## Assignment
This assignment was an open project. The only restrictions were it should use both software and hardware and should use some kind of data persistance.

Inspired in the famous game Keep Calm And Nobody Explodes, we decide to create a bomb defusal game with an Arduino Mega. The Arduino has different modules simulating modules of the bomb, and the player should do different activities simultaneously in order to succeed at the game. The activities the player must do are shown in a website, which also has a timer for the bomb to explode. 

The modules are divided in two categories: fixed and periodic. The player must complete 3 fixed challenges to win the game, but it won't be easy, as other challenges appear periodically to make things harder.

The fixed challenges are a Genius game and a puzzle to connect wires in an asked order. 

The periodic challenges involve timer, distance and light. The first one is a countdown that is reset when the player presses a button. The distance challenge requires the player to mantain some distance from the sensor for a specific amount of time. The light challenge works just like the distance one, but with light.

If the bomb timer reaches 0 or the player makes 3 failures in any of the challenges, the bomb explodes.

Good luck!
